                <h1>Theme</h1>
                <p>With environment being one of the most serious concerns, we have chosen our Theme to be<b> Green Economy: Role of Public Policy in Environmental Security</b>.</p>


<p>We seem to be living in a time of more extreme events, and environmental security is one of the most important issues. This January, we are trying to understand how the changing environment affects the economy of the nation and how appropriate public policies should be taken to combat the environmental threats. 
We don't know exactly what the future is going to look like, but it will be different than where we are today. Now it is on us to decide how do we want it to be.</p>
